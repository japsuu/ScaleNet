# ScaleNet WebSocket transport

This WebSocket transport is based on the MIT-licensed [Bayou](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/Bayou/) transport,
which itself is based on the MIT-licensed [SimpleWebTransport](https://github.com/James-Frowen/SimpleWebTransport) library.

This transport is designed to be used with the [ScaleNet](https://github.com/japsuu/ScaleNet) MMO networking library,
and is specifically optimized for the needs of ScaleNet.

- Most Unity-specific code has been stripped.
- The source has been cleaned up and optimized.
